# kjw-TaskList is just a task list I use

## kjw-TaskList is a conversion from the original ToDo Task list I made for classlist

About: Just an easy-to-use task list where you can create tasks quickly, then come back to them at a more convenient time to add additional information

It is a front end REACT interface paired with a backend Node.js with an API connection to the Mongo Atlas DB.

### Next Steps

### These enhancements are currently in Development as of 7/17/25

## Functional Blueprint: Task List Interaction System
## üìå Task Slot Memory
Tasks are assigned visual slots based on an indexed array.

Drag-and-drop actions update task position and persist this order via localStorage.

On app load, tasks are rendered using the stored slot structure, retaining user-defined layout.

## üñ±Ô∏è Interaction Effects
Each task responds visually to user engagement:

Click ‚Üí Ripple or pulse animation.

Edit ‚Üí Brief ‚Äújitter‚Äù to signal recognition.

Drag/Drop ‚Üí Ghost trail or static echo to preserve kinetic memory.

## üî¥ Critical Mode
Toggle triggers full red-toned overlay state for urgent visual clarity.

Tasks marked critical (late, flagged, high-priority with low progress) are:

Pulsing subtly with border animation.

Displaying trigger cause as blurred text above or beside their container (e.g., ‚ÄúMissed deadline‚Äù).

Overlay dims non-critical tasks, placing emphasis on attention targets.

## üß™ DB Toggle System
App operates in either Local Mode or Synced Mode.

Developer toggle switches between localStorage and external DB (e.g. Firebase).

DB mode enables cross-device slot memory, syncing user-defined order securely across platforms.
